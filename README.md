# Hello-World

Hello there

My name is Jade and I am currently a student who is very opstimistic. I am interested in business and technology. I am also someone with great interest in music. One of my favourite quotes is that ' Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain.
